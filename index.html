																<p>I am a South Sudanese national who was born overseas. I speak Dinka which is the second most widely spoken language in Sudan. Last year, I graduated from Simonds Catholic College (high school), and this is my first year at university. One unique aspect of my personality is that I enjoy reading, whether it's for financial literacy or just for pleasure. In addition, soccer piques my attention. <a href="http://html5up.net/license">Creative Commons</a>.</p>

																		<h2>Interest In IT</h2>
																		<p>What interests me about IT is the broad impact it has. The fact that leading technology companies today can/have large scale impact on millions through their products and services is amazing to me. Impacts such as communicating to individuals across the globe through text or call on services like WhatsApp are very personal to me as I have relatives overseas, I frequently communicate with. Moreover, I have had that interest of being a part of that impact since I got my first phone at 13. Therefore, the large-scale impact that technology has interests me the most.

									The decision behind studying at RMIT is influenced by the location and individuals I know of. RMIT being in city played a key role in the decision as I can study and intake business activities outside of school without having to travel that much.

									I expect to learn programming languages such as python, Java, etc., which is fundamental for computing. I also expect to learn about information management and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, I expect to develop an overall understanding of information systems.</p>

																<h2>Profile</h2>
																<p>I completed various tests used by employees to get specific information about potential employees. beloware the results.</p>
																<div class="features">
																	<section>
																		<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
																		<p>Personality type: Protagonist (ENFJ-A) Traits: Extraverted – 60%, Intuitive – 65%, Feeling – 57%, Judging – 86%, Assertive – 78%

									The concept of the protagonist makes them believe that they have a greater purpose in life. They are driven to serve others and make a difference in the world. Protagonists are born with charisma and passion. Their charisma allows them to motivate and inspire others. Relating to strengths, protagonists are receptive in recognising the importance of allowing others to express themselves even when they don’t agree with them. Few things bother Protagonists more than the prospect of letting down a person or cause that they believe in, which assures their reliability. In terms of passion, protagonists are far from being boring do-gooders. They take great pleasure in pursing their hobbies. Moreover, determined and inspiring, Protagonists often find their way into leadership roles, placing charismatic as one of their strengths.

									However, in addition to strengths, Protagonists hold weakness. Protagonists are unrealistic as most often pressure themselves to right every wrong they encounter. It is not realistic for them to solve all the world’s problems. Another weakness Protagonists hold is intense. Protagonists are rarely short on energy or determination, but they may not recognise that not everyone shares these qualities. This lack of recognition may result in them pushing others to make changes that they aren’t ready for or not interested in.

									Workplace Habits
									Warm, optimistic, charming, creative, and social protagonists. With the wind at their backs, Protagonists can excel in a wide range of roles and at any level of seniority. Furthermore, they are often personable and good-natured — attributes that can help them succeed in any situation where they must collaborate with others. Protagonists typically push themselves as employees to establish their worth and make a positive impression on their bosses. People with this personality type are perceptive and devoted, and they can handle various obligations with ease and good humour.</p>

																		<h3>Online learning style test</h3>
																		<p>Personality Max Learning style test results: 85% visual learner, 79% kinesthetics, 69% Auditory. Biar Deng's Personality Max™ Report Detailed results
									Learning Styles is a hypothesis that claims that varied styles of learning help people learn more effectively. We use our senses to take in information. Sight, hearing, and touch are the three most useful senses in a learning setting. Visual (V), Auditory (A), and kinesthetics (K) are classified as learning styles in the VAK paradigm. Visual is my primary learning style. This style is learning by seeing, whether that be pictures, charts, diagrams, videos, etc. My primary learning style (visual) is determined by my ability comprehend visual information such as charts, graphs and diagrams, as well as appreciate pictures and illustrations in books. Moreover, my ability to recognise/ remember people’s faces more than their names and accurately recognize body language and facial expressions also plays a role in visual being my primary learning style. Kinesthetics is my secondary learning style. Kinesthetics is learning by doing. When you capture new knowledge through the process of physical action, you learn in this way. I am good at learning via hands-on experience which supports kinesthetics as my secondary learning style. Furthermore, I get satisfaction from building with my hands, adding to my kinesthetics learning style. Auditory is my least preferred learning style. Learning through ear is known as auditory style. An auditory learner can readily understand, process, and remember information during a lecture. This is my least preferred learning style as I often forget things, showed in my inability to accurately remember people’s names.</p>

																		<h3>Creativity Test: Curiosity, Imagination, Complexity, Risk Tolerance</h3>
																		<p>Risk: 19/26 Curiosity: 19/24 Complexity: 15/26 Imagination: 13/24 Overall creativity score: 66/100

									Risk involves exposure to danger from the uncertainty. When it comes to risk, I like to think positive of the outcome rather than negative. This places me in a position to handle the uncertainty adequately. Furthermore, in most cases, I calculate the risk and work on ways to reduce that risk to the lowest it can be. I, for example, am a stock trader. Risk is a significant component in the stock market. So, if I research a company and find it to be high risk, I either put a modest order or try to time the market to minimise risk. Therefore, my ability to minimize risk increases my capability of reducing errors in codes/programs in roles like IT support analyst.

									Curiosity refers to a great desire to learn more about something. Curiosity accounts for a significant portion of my personality. I'm always curious about how things operate. For example, as a youngster, I was always curious in how an automobile works. When I saw a YouTube video, my interest was piqued. As a result, curiosity can assist me in designing and developing programmes for modern-day solutions.

									Complexity refers to the state of being elaborate or convoluted. When I find myself in a difficult position, I break it down and deal with it one step at a time. To increase my capacity to do complicated jobs, I enjoy playing strategy games. In addition, I like problem solving, which helps me deal with difficult situations and duties. As a result, my ability to deal with complexity can help me in my role as an IT support analyst, where I am frequently confronted with complicated tasks that programmers are unable to handle or often miss.

									Finally, my imagination may be beneficial in the realm of technology. Imagining things from a new perspective is something I do frequently. A common example I see is imagining how a website might appear if the theme colour was altered. Furthermore, I enjoy imagining various future possibilities, such as being the first to discover something new, such as a new software to solve an existing problem. Because AI is built on imagination, it plays a significant role in the tech sector.</p>

																<h2>Project Idea</h2>
																<p>My project is an app for healthy eating.</p>
																<div class="features">
																	<section>
																		<h3>Overview </h3>
																		<p>This recipe app will focus on bringing the greatest healthy meals to fitness consumers in one place. The app will collect recipes from health professionals, either directly or through a reliable website or source, and save them in an app for users' convenience. My healthy recipe app will assist users in finding and viewing various food recipes based on various categories and parameters, as well as allowing them to submit their own recipes to the app. The user may narrow down the selection of pre- and post-workout meals depending on the items they have on hand, as well as factors such as prep time and calories. The app strives to be efficient while still being user-friendly.</p>
																	</section>
																	<section>
																		<h3>Motivation</h3>
																		<p>With 44 per cent of its residents being obese, Australia places fifth in the fattest countries in the world. Diet is a major reason for Australia ranking high in obesity. As a fitness enthusiast, I find this app interesting because it is simple to use and contains recipes that are both healthy and effective. In terms of the app’s usability, I often find it difficult to browse the web for healthy recipe selections for my pre and post workouts as there is endless sites suggesting healthy recipes, making it hard to read and decide on the best ones. Therefore, applications like mine, which store and save healthy recipes at the user’s convenience are quite useful.</p>
																	</section>
																	<section>
																		<h3>Description </h3>
																		<p>After opening the app, a home screen (feed) with images and suggested recipes will appear. In the top-right of the screen will be three dots (More options Icon) which opens the side tab (the menu), displaying the user’s profile, pre-workout recipes, post- workout recipes, other recipes, notes, bookmark, reminder and the settings tab on the bottom of the side page. 
									The main page (feed) will seem like a social networking page, with healthy cooking ideas. These suggestions may come from other users or the app itself. Popular recipes will be available alongside the recommendations. These are the recipes with the most positive feedback, indicating that the user may enjoy them as well.
									The user’s profile will include the user’s personal detains (such as name, email, avatar/picture) as well as their current locations, so that recommendations in their region can appear on their feed. In the profile, you'll have the ability to alter your username or password. Healthy meals that are best suited and advised by professionals for before workout will be displayed in the pre-workout tab and vice versa for post-workout recipes. The ‘other recipes tab’ will comprise appetite foods that are not really nutritious, but which the user craves. As this feature may not be appropriate for healthy eating, it will be locked every week, waiting to be unlocked by cooking five or more recipes in a week. This lock-unlock feature will discourage bad diet while rewarding the user for consistency. 
									Overall, within the recipe tabs, there will be categories. For example, all three tabs will have light and heavy meals. This category will allow the user to make an informed decision based on the percentage they desire. Preparation time will be another category (quick and standard prep times). Having the prep time category will allow the user to pick recipes based on their available time. Allergic free tab could be a possible category. This category would contain all the recipes free from common allergies like peanuts, milk, etc. 
									In addition, each user will have their own bookmark tab to save and keep their favourite recipes. The option to add a recipe to the bookmark will be displayed in the More options icon on the top-left of a recipe. The option to add notes and the option to add a comment will be the two remaining dots on the top-left of the recipe. The note option will take you to the recipe's notes page, where you can add any steps or sidenotes you desire. The comments feature allows the user to post or browse comments about the recipe from other users. Users will rate the recipe positively or negatively in the comments, which will be used as a review. The reminder tab will enable the user to select recipes for certain times, they will need reminding for. Moreover, the settings will enable users to check the data policy and terms of use.
